# [Conscripting SQL loving elves](https://adventofsql.com/challenges/22)

## Description

Santa, facing competition from Amazon's same-day drone delivery, realized efficiency was crucial to preserving Christmas traditions. Determined to outmaneuver the tech giant, he demanded a query of the workshopâ€™s Skills table to identify elves proficient in SQL. Eldrin, Faenor, and Luthien rose to the challenge, using their expertise to find coders and logistics experts.

With data-driven strategies and a dedicated SQL team, Santa optimized his operations in time for Christmas Eve. Armed with tradition and technology, his workshop prepared to uphold the magic of Christmas, ensuring Amazon's drones wouldn't outshine his sleigh.
